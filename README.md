# Platonic

This is a prototype for a game where you switch between a 2D(orthographic camera) and 3D(perspective camera) world.

The Player can switch between both worlds but in the 3D world they can still see the 2D world as a piece of paper. Some objects in the world will be in both worlds. As an example there is a circle in the 2D world you can move around this will also move a cylinder in the 3D world.

I also prototyped a shaders to get a thick outline around 3D objects so they look like drawings with an ouline.

Made in Unity 2020.3.19f1 using the Universal Render Pipeline.
